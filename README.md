### Reflection
1. What is the difference between the approach of performance testing with JMeter and profiling with IntelliJ Profiler in the context of optimizing application performance?

When we use JMeter, we're testing how the application behaves under load, like checking how fast a website loads on a busy day. Profiling with IntelliJ Profiler, however, is about finding out which specific parts of our code are slowing things down or using up memory.

2. How does the profiling process help you in identifying and understanding the weak points in your application?

Profiling shows me detailed information about how my code runs. It goes through my application while it's running. It's like having a tracker on every line of my code. This helps me to see exactly where the slow parts are.
   
3. Do you think IntelliJ Profiler is effective in assisting you to analyze and identify bottlenecks in your application code?

Yes, IntelliJ Profiler is good for digging into the code and finding where the bottlenecks are, which means finding the exact spots where the code gets stuck or slow.

4. What are the main challenges you face when conducting performance testing and profiling, and how do you overcome these challenges?

Some big challenges include figuring out where to start optimizing, making sure I’m testing the right scenarios, and understanding the profiling data. To overcoming these, I need to be methodical, start with the biggest issues first, and sometimes I need to ask for help or use online resources to learn more.

5.	What are the main benefits you gain from using IntelliJ Profiler for profiling your application code?

Using IntelliJ Profiler can give me a very clear picture of where my code can be improved, which can help me make my software run faster and more efficiently.

6.	How do you handle situations where the results from profiling with Inte	lliJ Profiler are not entirely consistent with findings from performance testing using JMeter?

When results from IntelliJ Profiler and JMeter don't match up, I need to investigate further, check everything again, and use additional tools if necessary to understand it. It could be due to testing the wrong scenario or something else entirely.

7.	What strategies do you implement in optimizing application code after analyzing results from performance testing and profiling? How do you ensure the changes you make do not affect the application's functionality?

After testing and profiling, I would carefully make changes to the code, one step at a time, and test those changes to make sure they're actually helping. It’s important not to change too much at once so I can easily see what helps and what doesn’t.
